# Multiplexer_8x1

A multiplexer is a device that selects one output from multiple inputs. It is also known as a data selector.We refer to a multiplexer with the terms MUX.

A multiplexer is a combinational type of digital circuits that are used to transfer one of the available input lines to the single output and, which input has to be transferred to the output it will be decided by the state(logic 0 or logic 1) of the select line signal.

2:1 Multiplexer is having two inputs, one select line (to select one of the two input) and a single output. 

In the 8 to 1 multiplexer, there are total eight inputs, i.e., A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, and A7, 3 selection lines, i.e., S0, S1and S2 and single output, i.e., Y. On the basis of the combination of inputs that are present at the selection lines S0, S1, and S2, one of these 8 inputs are connected to the output.
